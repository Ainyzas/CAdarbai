//! Tips
// collect elements to constants (e.g. startButton, secondsFiels, minutesField, ring)
// add event listener on startButton and on click:
// if it was START that was pressed, start interval with function, which will change values of minutes and seconds every interval;
// if it was STOP that was pressed, stop interval;
// ...
// Good luck...
